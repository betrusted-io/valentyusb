            This is a three-FIFO USB device.  It presents one FIFO each for ``IN``, ``OUT``, and
            ``SETUP`` data.  This allows for up to 16 ``IN`` and 16 ``OUT`` endpoints
            without sacrificing many FPGA resources.

            USB supports four types of transfers: control, bulk, interrupt, and isochronous.
            This device does not yet support isochronous transfers, however it supports the
            other types of transfers.
            """)

        self.interrupt_bulk_transfers = ModuleDoc(title="Interrupt and Bulk Transfers", body="""
            Interrupt and bulk transfers are similar from an implementation standpoint --
            they differ only in terms of how often they are transmitted.

            These transfers can be made to any endpoint, and may even be interleaved.  However,
            due to the nature of ``TriEndpointInterface`` any attempt by the host to interleave
            transfers will result in a ``NAK``, and the host will retry later when the buffer
            is empty.

            IN Transfers
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^

            To make an ``IN`` transfer (i.e. to send data to the host), write the data to
            ``IN_DATA``.  This is a FIFO, and each write to this endpoint will advance the
            FIFO pointer automatically.  This FIFO is 64 bytes deep.  USB ``DATA`` packets
            contain a CRC16 checksum, which is automatically added to any ``IN`` transfers.

            ``TriEndpointInterface`` will continue to respond ``NAK`` until you arm the buffer.
            Do this by writing the endpoint number to ``IN_CTRL.EPNO``.  This will tell the device
            that it should send the data the next time the host asks for it.

            Once the data has been transferred, the device will raise an interrupt and you
            can begin re-filling the buffer, or fill it with data for a different endpoint.

            To send an empty packet, avoid writing any data to ``IN_DATA`` and simply write
            the endpoint number to ``IN_CTRL.EPNO``.

            The CRC16 will be automatically appended to the end of the transfer.

            OUT Transfers
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

            To respond to an ``OUT`` transfer (i.e. to receive data from the host), enable
            a particular endpoint by writing to ``OUT_CTRL.EPNO`` with the ``OUT_CTRL.ENABLE``
            bit set.  This will tell the device to stop responding ``NAK`` to that particular
            endpoint and to accept any incoming data into a 66-byte FIFO, provided the FIFO
            is empty.

            Once the host sends data, an interrupt will be raised and that particular endpoint's
            ``ENABLE`` will be set to ``0``.  This prevents any additional data from entering
            the FIFO while the device examines the data.

            The FIFO will contain two extra bytes, which are the two-byte CRC16 of the packet.
            You can safely discard these bytes.  Because of this, a zero-byte transfer will
            be two-bytes, and a full 64-byte transfer will be 66 bytes.

            To determine which endpoint the ``OUT`` packet was sent to, refer to
            ``OUT_STATUS.EPNO``.  This field is only updated when a successful packet is received,
            and will not change until the ``OUT`` FIFO is re-armed.

            The ``OUT`` FIFO will continue to respond to the host with with ``NAK`` until the
            ``OUT_EV_PENDING.DONE`` bit is cleared.

            Additionally, to continue receiving data on that particular endpoint, you will need
            to re-enable it by writing the endpoint number, along with the ``OUT_CTRL.ENABLE``
            to ``OUT_CTRL``.
            """)
        self.control_transfers = ModuleDoc(title="Control Transfers", body="""
            Control transfers are complicated, and are the first sort of transfer that
            the host uses.  Such transfers have three distinct phases.

            The first phase is the ``SETUP`` phase, where the host sends an 8-byte ``SETUP``
            packet.  These ``SETUP`` packets must always be acknowledged, so any such packet
            from the host will get loaded into the ``SETUP`` FIFO immediately, and an interrupt
            event raised.  If, for some reason, the device hasn't drained this ``SETUP``
            FIFO from a previous transaction, the FIFO will be cleared automatically.

            Once the ``SETUP`` packet is handled, the host will send an ``IN`` or ``OUT``
            packet.  If the host sends an ``OUT`` packet, then the ``OUT`` buffer must be
            cleared, the ``OUT.DONE`` interrupt handled, and the ``OUT_CTRL.ENABLE`` bit
            must be set for the appropriate endpoint, usually EP0.  The device will not
            accept any data as long as these three conditions are not met.

            If the host sends an ``IN`` packet, the device will respond with ``NAK`` if
            no data has queued.  To queue data, fill the ``IN_DATA`` buffer, then write
            ``0`` to ``IN_CTRL``.

            You can continue to fill the buffer (for ``IN`` packets) or drain the buffer
            and re-enable the endpoint (for ``OUT`` packets) until the host has finished
            the transfer.

            When the host has finished, it will send the opposite packet type.  If it
            is making ``IN`` transfers, it will send a single ``OUT`` packet, or if it
            is making ``OUT`` transfers it will send a single ``IN`` packet.
            You must handle this transaction yourself.

            Stalling an Endpoint
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

            When the host sends a request that cannot be processed -- for example requesting
            a descriptor that does not exist -- the device must respond with ``STALL``.

            Each endpoint keeps track of its own ``STALL`` state, though a ``SETUP`` packet
            will clear the ``STALL`` state for the specified endpoint (usually EP0).

            To set or clear the ``STALL`` bit of an ``IN`` endpoint, write its endpoint number
            to ``IN_CTRL.EPNO`` with the ``IN_CTRL.STALL`` bit either set or clear.  If
            this bit is set, then the device will respond to the next ``IN`` packet from the
            host to that particular endpoint with ``STALL``.  If the bit is clear, then
            the next ``IN`` packet will be responded to with ``ACK`` and the contents of
            the ``IN`` FIFO.

            To stall an ``OUT`` endpoint, write to ``OUT_CTRL.EPNO`` with the ``OUT_CTRL.STALL``
            and ``OUT_CTRL.ENABLE`` bits set.  To unstall, write to ``OUT_CTRL.EPNO`` with the
            ``OUT_CTRL.STALL`` bit and ``OUT_CTRL.ENABLE`` bits cleared.  Note that
            ``OUT_CTRL.ENABLE`` indicates whether any response sould be sent at all, which is
            why it must be set or cleared at the same time.

        #### Then the functionality is broken. The problem is that reset is a "pulse" type field,
        #### but then the control signal is also considered by the ".re" accessor. In a fully
        #### synchronous system, Reset would arrive on the same edge as the ctrl.re accessor,
        #### and the If/then logic below would work.
        #### However, if due to differential routing delays, one synchronizer tends to cross
        #### a domain before the other, it's possible that reset "beats" ctrl.re by one cycle
        #### after crossing the synchronizer, thus causing the state machine to first go into
        #### reset, and then subsequently execute the "then" clause considering the "ctrl.re & ~stall"

    Endpoint for Host->Device transaction

    When a host wants to send data to a device, it sends an ``OUT`` token.  The device
    should then respond with ``ACK``, or ``NAK``.  This handler is responsible for managing
    this response, as well as reading data from the USB subsystem.

    To enable receiving data, write a ``1`` to the ``OUT_CTRL.ENABLE`` bit.

    To drain the FIFO, read from ``OUT.DATA``.  Don't forget to re-
    enable the FIFO by ensuring ``OUT_CTRL.ENABLE`` is set after advancing the FIFO!
